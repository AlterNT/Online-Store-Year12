# Online Store Website - Year 12 Project

## Purpose and Goals

The original goal of this assignment was to create an online store mockup of a chosen theme.

In this case, I chose a retro/80s/synthwave feel for the site, hence the rather... odd. color choices. 

Furthemore, I took this assignment as an excuse to explore the Angular framework, web components (as they were fairly new at the time) and Google's material design language.

## Application Stack

- Angular - Base Framework
- Angular Material - CSS Framework
- SCSS - Styling

## Functionality

Given the limited time available for the assignment, I only managed to complete the main goal of a mockup design. As a result, there is little functionality beyond the main structure of the site. However I did complete adding to the cart/emptying it upon checkout, as well as basic responsiveness for different screen sizes (could use refinement).

## Deployment

Simply git clone the website and run the command `npm install && ng serve`

The site is currently availible to view [here](https://ntps.netlify.app/).
